### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Full Stack/Front End WordPress developer and ecommerce specialist with over 15 years experience building and maintaining large scale ecommerce stores, education and non-profit websites. I build clean, fast, responsive websites that look great and perform well in all environments. I deliver great work on schedule, care deeply about my work, and delight in the process.

I know analytics, ERPs, strategic marketing, and user-friendly design. I have a lifetime of experience in business to quickly see what works and what doesn't: in websites, in processes, in projects.

I specialize in modern front-end web technologiesâ€”CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript. I also have a deep knowledge of WordPress.

My skills include a ruthless attention to detail, honing in on problem areas like coding issues or implementation snags.

I work with Git, SASS, jQuery, Gulp, Chrome Devtools, and other modern development tools for efficiency and performance. I am skilled at Adobe Photoshop, and very familiar with Linux and Apple software.
